ArchivesSpace Plugin to provide local CSS declarations within the PUI.
===============

## Getting Started

Enable the plugin by editing the file in `config/config.rb`:

    AppConfig[:plugins] >> 'yale_css'

Update the "yale.css" file as desired.

Restart the application.

Note: this is just for testing purposes.  We'll incorporate these changes another way once we launch with the PUI.
